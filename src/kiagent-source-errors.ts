 * Typed source-failure taxonomy shared by the engine, the bundled sources,

 * runtime classes live in their own module (same rationale as the version
 * constant in extension-rpc.ts).
 *
 * The engine keys off the `code` PROPERTY, never `instanceof` — an error
 * rehydrated from the extension-child wire (or from a differently-bundled
 * copy of this module) is a plain Error carrying `code`, and that must
 * classify identically to a locally-thrown SourceAuthError.
